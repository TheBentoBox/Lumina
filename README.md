# Lumina
Light the way.

In Lumina, players control a wizard who can cast spells using differing combinations of spell types and elements. The original concept grew from the idea of a sidescrolling tower defense, and eventually evolved into what it is now.

Currently the gameplay, including the "goals", are very simple, as the base mechanics are still in development. You can find waystones across each of the four game biomes. Once activated via touch, they can be used to freely teleport to their pairing waystone in the clearing.

The end goal of Lumina would have slower progression with more deliberate encounters and world layout. The player would be able to invest in useful consumables and skill upgrades that would be craftable via a combination of earned experience and resources found in the world or dropped by enemies.
